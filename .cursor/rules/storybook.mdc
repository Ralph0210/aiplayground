# Storybook Usage

- Global CSS is imported in [.storybook/preview.ts](mdc:.storybook/preview.ts)
- Write stories under `src/stories/**.stories.tsx`
- Prefer token utilities from the design system; avoid raw hex and pixel values
- Use `parameters.layout = 'centered' | 'padded'` appropriately
- Controls: expose `variant` and `size` for components like CTA buttons
- Accessibility: keep `@storybook/addon-a11y` enabled and address violations in stories
